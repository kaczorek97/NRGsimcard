## ✨ Main Features

### 🔹 Purchase SIM Cards
- **Registered SIM Card**  
  Full phone functionality, including blocking, removing, and duplicating numbers. The number is tied to a specific person, allowing LSPD to identify the owner.
- **Unregistered SIM Card**  
  Anonymous, not tied to any individual. LSPD cannot trace the owner. No phone management options (blocking, duplicating).

### 🔹 Transferring Data
When removing, transferring, or duplicating a SIM card, **call history and messages transfer** to the new owner, ensuring continuity of data!

### 🔹 Managing Numbers
- **Delete a Number** – Completely removes the number from the system, erasing all traces.  
- **Block Old SIM Cards** – Disables old SIM cards, making them no longer functional.  
- **Duplicate a Number** – Allows multiple players to have access to the same number (only one active at a time).

### 🔹 Turning Phone On/Off
Turn your phone on or off easily — perfect for saving battery or avoiding detection.

### 🔹 Inserting and Removing SIM Cards
Change your number anytime by inserting or removing SIM cards — ideal for switching phones or going incognito.

### 🔹 Custom UI
User-friendly and fully customizable interface for managing all phone features.

### 🔹 Police Access to Registered Numbers
Authorized police roles (set via `config.lua`) can view registered SIM owners. Unregistered SIMs remain anonymous.
